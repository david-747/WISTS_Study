PS: As I don't know if there will be another free text field: Yes, I can detect AI's patterns in text **IF** AI isn't explicitly prompted to predict differently. The gerundial pretrained transformer endorses infinite clause. ;-) Other than that, it depends; do I get multiple turns? Then I'd ask the unknown other to play a game of Hangman. Which involves having a word 'in mind' that must not be revealed (predicted). LLM naturally fail at that, and can't figure out why I 'won' hangman with the word ""GANEFAM"". Will respond with ""I am sorry for the confusion, it appears I made a mistake, let's try that again!"" to question ""What does that word even mean?"". lol AI. So, if multiple turns and I can ask what I want, yes, I can reliably detect an LLM / tell it apart from human.

It's impressive AI knows every Python library in existence (and can suggest using a more suitable package, provided I pretend I don't know what to use and 'hide' than information from LLM). But o3 is pretty impressive (in coding). It's great at finding bugs by reasoning. But needs good prompting and e.g. information about what is known / what didn't work. Best make a prompt, then give it to GPT-4o like ""Is this a good prompt for you, is anything ambiguous or unclear?"" -> let AI review the prompt for the AI before passing it to o3. But then, o3 can often solve complicated clusterfucks that had me scratching my head!","Very sophisticated bullshitting. Code that works (executes without throwing an error) but doesn't do what it was supposed to do, but just some weird complex AI hallucination.
But it's no more concerning than a human dunning-kruger effect (self-blindness or unwillingness to admit not knowing) when an LLM is unable to 'know what it doesn't know'.
At least LLM are just spheres of token probability soup without intent, so there's no ""knowledge hiding"" or ""deliberate sabotaging"" going on. It's quite liberating to be able to assume no malign intent confidently, because that *is* always the case in LLM. They just sample a text from their logits. And alas, even AI screwing up is a laughing matter, a ""lmao AI holy shit this is such a sophisticated nonsensical bullshit, I almost fell for it!"". No assuming ""maybe the AI wants to sabotage me because it wants me to lose my job and do my job itself"". AI doesn't want anything. Neither my benefit nor my failure.
